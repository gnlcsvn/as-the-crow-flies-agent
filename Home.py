    Welcome to our demo on As-The-Crow-Flies (ATCF) navigation for cyclists. This alternative approach to turn-by-turn navigation provides a unique experience by offering the beeline to the destination. Dive into our two detailed sections to understand the simulation and the underlying city graph statistics.

    st.write("""
    ATCF navigation utilizes the least-angle strategy, offering a unique beeline route to the destination. While it presents an exciting alternative for cyclists, it's not without its challenges, such as occasionally running into dead ends. Our research dives deep into understanding the relationship between street network attributes and the user experience of this navigation method. Through extensive analysis across 1633 cities, we uncover the key characteristics of the ideal city for ATCF and present design implications for its future implementations.
